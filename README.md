## What I learnt

In taking and implementing this project through with the instructor, I have been able to do a number of things.

1. I have been able to successfully implement the use of mixins with variables. This was exciting to see me implement in this project. Code sample:

```scss
@mixin circle($size) {
  width: $size;
  height: $size;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

2. Learning CSS animations and transitions have always been a big deal for me; this project opened my mind in understand how they work in simple and even some advanced implementations.

3. I learnt some limitations to having multiple animations and also how to go around about it.

## Adjustments from original project

1. Created css variables for each of the planets' colors. This makes the entire css colors and theme adjustable with ease. Code sample:

## Future Updates o Functionalaties

1. Hide scrollbar while overflow is still scollble to view.
